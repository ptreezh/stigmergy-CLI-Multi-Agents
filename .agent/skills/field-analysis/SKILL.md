# Field Analysis Skill (Bourdieu-inspired)

## Overview
场域分析技能基于布迪厄的社会学理论，为社会科学研究提供分析社会场域结构、权力关系和文化资本分布的框架。该技能帮助研究者识别场域边界、分析资本分布、评估场域自主性并理解行动者的习性模式。

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when the user requests:
- Analysis of social fields or domains (education, politics, art, etc.)
- Identification of field boundaries and rules of the game
- Analysis of capital distribution and power relations
- Assessment of field autonomy from external forces
- Understanding of habitus and its relationship to field structure
- Investigation of struggles and power dynamics within fields
- Analysis of how social positions are structured and reproduced
- Examination of the relationship between objective conditions and subjective dispositions

## Quick Start
When a user requests field analysis:
1. **Identify** the specific field and its boundaries
2. **Map** positions and relationships within the field
3. **Analyze** capital distribution and power relations
4. **Assess** field autonomy and historical development
5. **Interpret** findings in social context

## Core Functions (Progressive Disclosure)

### Primary Functions
- **Field Mapping**: Identify positions and relations within the field
- **Capital Analysis**: Identify and map different types of capital
- **Power Relations**: Identify dominant and dominated positions
- **Basic Habitus**: Understand participants' dispositions

### Secondary Functions
- **Boundary Analysis**: Define field boundaries and exclusions
- **Struggle Dynamics**: Analyze ongoing struggles and their stakes
- **Autonomy Assessment**: Evaluate independence from external forces
- **Historical Analysis**: Trace field development over time

### Advanced Functions
- **Symbolic Violence**: Identify mechanisms of domination and misrecognition
- **Multi-field Analysis**: Examine relationships between fields
- **Field Evolution**: Analyze changes in field structure
- **Complex Habitus**: Examine how habitus enables/constrains practice

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Field Identification
   - Clearly define the field of analysis
   - Identify the specific social space being examined
   - Establish the historical and geographical context
   - Determine the relevant time period for analysis

### 2. Field Mapping
   - Create a relational map of positions within the field
   - Identify the key actors and their positions
   - Analyze the objective relations between positions
   - Determine the principles of division within the field

### 3. Capital Analysis
   - Identify the different types of capital valued in the field
   - Map the distribution of capital among participants
   - Analyze how capital is converted and recognized
   - Examine how capital shapes position-taking

### 4. Power Relations Analysis
   - Identify dominant and dominated positions
   - Analyze the struggles occurring within the field
   - Examine the stakes of these struggles
   - Understand how power is exercised and contested

### 5. Autonomy Assessment
   - Evaluate the field's autonomy from external forces
   - Analyze the degree of field-specific logic
   - Identify mechanisms of symbolic violence
   - Assess the field's historical development

### 6. Habitus Understanding
   - Analyze the dispositions of field participants
   - Examine how objective conditions shape subjective dispositions
   - Understand the relationship between structure and agency
   - Consider how habitus enables and constrains practice

### 7. Synthesis and Interpretation
   - Integrate findings from all dimensions
   - Connect field analysis to broader social processes
   - Consider Chinese social context and cultural specificities
   - Provide actionable insights
