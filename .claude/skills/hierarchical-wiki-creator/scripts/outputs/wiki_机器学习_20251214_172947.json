              "content": "Topic modelling has been a successful technique for text analysis for almost twenty years. When topic modelling met deep neural networks, there emerged a new and increasingly popular research area, neural topic models, with over a hundred models developed and a wide range of applications in neural language understanding such as text generation, summarisation and language models. There is a need to summarise research developments and discuss open problems and future directions. In this paper, we provide a focused yet comprehensive overview of neural topic models for interested researchers in the AI community, so as to facilitate them to navigate and innovate in this fast-growing research area. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first review focusing on this specific topic.",

              "content": "This paper presents an intertemporal bimodal network to analyze the evolution of the semantic content of a scientific field within the framework of topic modeling, namely using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The main contribution is the conceptualization of the topic dynamics and its formalization and codification into an algorithm. To benchmark the effectiveness of this approach, we propose three indexes which track the transformation of topics over time, their rate of birth and death, and the novelty of their content. Applying the LDA, we test the algorithm both on a controlled experiment and on a corpus of several thousands of scientific papers over a period of more than 100 years which account for the history of the economic thought.",

We use a multi-modal topic model as a basis for defining such a similarity between objects.

Topics are not guaranteed to be well interpretable, therefore, coherence measures have been proposed to distinguish between good and bad topics. Studies of topic coherence so far are limited to measures that score pairs of individual words. For the first time, we include coherence measures from scientific philosophy that score pairs of more complex word subsets and apply them to topic scoring.",
