stigmergy skill list

# Read skill content (for AI agents)
stigmergy skill read pdf

# Remove a skill

stigmergy skill validate ./my-skill/SKILL.md

# Sync skills to AGENTS.md
stigmergy skill sync
```

### Use Skills in AI CLI

#### In Claude Code

```javascript
// Read skill content
Bash("stigmergy skill read algorithmic-art")

// Use skill
claude> Use the algorithmic-art skill to create generative art
```

#### Cross-CLI Skill Sharing

Skills installed with Stigmergy are automatically available across all AI CLI tools:

```bash
# Install once in Claude
stigmergy skill install vercel-labs/agent-skills

# Use in any CLI
claude> stigmergy skill read pdf

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Interactive Mode with Project Status Board

Stigmergy's interactive mode features a **Project Status Board** that enables cross-session collaboration through persistent shared state. Different CLI sessions automatically collaborate based on the project status, with automatic context injection.

```bash
# Start interactive session
stigmergy interactive
# or use the alias
stigmergy i
```

Once in interactive mode, you can use these commands:

#### Interactive Commands

```bash
# View project status board
> status
# Shows: tasks, findings, decisions, collaboration history

# Show cross-CLI context
> context
# Displays context from all CLI tools

# Switch to specific CLI
> use qwen
> use claude
> use iflow
> use gemini

# Execute task with automatic context injection
> your task here

# Exit interactive mode
> exit
```

#### Key Features

**📊 Project Status Board**
- Each project directory has its own independent status board
- Stored in `.stigmergy/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- Tracks tasks, findings, decisions, and collaboration history
- Automatically updates as you work

**🔄 Cross-Session Collaboration**
- Different sessions read/write to the same status board
- Automatic context injection from previous work
- Shared memory across CLI tools and sessions

**🌳 Directory Isolation**
- Each project directory = independent status board
- Working in `/projectA` won't affect `/projectB`
- Subdirectories can have independent boards (optional)

**Example Session:**

```bash
$ stigmergy interactive

========================================
  Stigmergy Interactive Mode
========================================
Session ID: session-abc123
Use 'status' to view project state
Use 'help' for available commands

# View current status
> status
========================================
  项目全局状态看板
========================================

```

#### Single vs Multi-Board Mode

**Single Board Mode (Default)**
- Best for small projects (< 10 modules)
- One status board for entire project
- Simple, unified perspective

```bash
cd my-small-project/
stigmergy i
> All work recorded to: .stigmergy/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md
```

**Multi-Board Mode (Optional)**
- Best for large projects or microservices
- Each subdirectory has independent board
- Enables parallel team development

```bash
cd my-large-project/
stigmergy i
> board init multi
> board create backend ./backend
> board create frontend ./frontend

cd backend/
stigmergy i
> use qwen
qwen> design database schema
✓ Recorded to: backend/.stigmergy/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md
```

**Directory Isolation Guaranteed:**
```
projectA/.stigmergy/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md  ← Project A's board
projectB/.stigmergy/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md  ← Project B's board
# Complete isolation, no mixing
```

### Resume Sessions

```bash
# List recent sessions
stigmergy resume --limit 10

# Resume specific session
stigmergy resume --session-id abc123

# Simple resume
stigmergy resume
```

### Project Commands

```bash
# Setup project
stigmergy setup

# Initialize in current directory
stigmergy init

# Deploy hooks only
stigmergy deploy hooks

# Deploy skills integration
stigmergy deploy skills
```

3. `~/.agent/skills/` - Global universal skills
4. `./.claude/skills/` - Project Claude skills
5. `~/.claude/skills/` - Global Claude skills

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable debug mode
export DEBUG=true

# Force auto-install during npm install

npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
# etc.
```

### Hooks Not Deployed

```bash
# Redeploy hooks
stigmergy deploy hooks --force
